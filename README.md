## Introduction

In this repository, you'll find implementations of common data structures along with examples that showcase their usage. Each data structure is organized in its own directory, containing the implementation code and usage examples.

I hope this repository can serve as both a learning tool for beginners and a reference for those seeking to refresh their understanding of data structures.

## Data Structures Included

- Linked Lists
- Stacks
- Queues
- Trees (Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, AVL Trees, etc.)
- Graphs
- Hash Tables
- Heaps


Each data structure directory contains the following:

- Implementation code
- Usage examples
- Explanation of the data structure's properties and methods

## Contributing

Contributions to this repository are welcome! If you have improvements, additional data structure implementations, or better usage examples, please feel free to submit a pull request. Before contributing, make sure to read the [Contributing Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).
